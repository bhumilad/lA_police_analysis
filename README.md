## 🧠 Key Business Questions
- Which neighborhoods experience the highest crime rates?
- What are the most common crime types, and when do they peak?
- Are there patterns in crime based on time of day or day of week?
- Which age/gender groups are most targeted?
- How do weapons and crime premises vary by incident?

- Identified high-crime divisions such as **Central**, **Wilshire**, and **Hollywood** using **interactive heatmaps** and **neighborhood-level filters**.

### 🕓 Temporal Trends
- Crimes peak on **Friday afternoons and evenings**
- Created **time series charts** to visualize **weekly & daily patterns**
- Spotted **reporting delays** by comparing incident vs report times

### 👤 Victim Demographics
- Visualized age and gender distributions across crime types
- Found specific targeting of **youth (11–20 years)** in certain areas

### 🔫 Weapon Usage & Crime Types
- Guns, knives, and strong-arm tactics were most common
- Top crime types included **burglary**, **vehicle theft**, and **assault**
- Created comparative visualizations of **weapon vs premise type**
